The data source is [Realtor](https://www.realtor.com/research/data/). 

The data MARKET HOTNESS comes from different levels. Since I am now working on the project of Houston, I focus on the "zip data", which is the historical data of the median home prices on the neighborhood level. 

All the zipcodes in the houston metro area are aggregated, and represented with the median value.
